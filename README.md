## More details
I'm an aspiring and super pumped beginner web developer, ready to rock the world of web development! I'm on the lookout for opportunities to dive into HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create awesome and user-friendly websites that people will love. I'm all about learning and growing, and I can't wait to become a web development whiz!

Besides coding, another big passion of mine is playing **Arknights**, a fantastic mobile game ðŸŽ®! I love the strategic gameplay, unique characters, and captivating storyline it offers. It's just so much fun to collect operators and deploy them in tactical battles.
